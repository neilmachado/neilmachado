Proven expertise in Security Operations Center (SOC) environments, adept at monitoring, analyzing, and responding to security incidents. Skilled in implementing and maintaining cybersecurity measures to safeguard organizational assets. 

The seeds of my interest were planted during my undergraduate years as I delved into subjects like Cryptography & System Security and Hardware Security, I found myself captivated by the intricate dance between technology and security. The realization that the digital landscape was rife with challenges and opportunities to safeguard sensitive information ignited a profound curiosity within me.

To formalize and expand my expertise, I pursued certifications such as CompTIA Security+, Google Professional Cybersecurity Certificate, and Cisco Cyber Threat Management. My practical immersion into the field took shape during my role as a Security Project Intern at 7LeadGen, Inc. During this transformative experience, I honed my skills in incident response, vulnerability analysis, and aligning security controls using the NIST framework. Crafting user-friendly guides on secure password practices became a creative outlet, fostering a heightened security culture among colleagues.

The pinnacle of my journey thus far has been my role as a Cybersecurity Project Intern at Curacao in Los Angeles. Here, I took the helm in leading the migration of outdated DOS systems to secure Windows 10 installations. This hands-on experience not only sharpened my technical acumen but also showcased my ability to navigate complex projects and bolster security postures.
